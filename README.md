## Metis_project2: Cost of a Home in San Francisco

### Description
High paid jobs, great food, fun activities, fabulous weather, just to name a few of the reasons San Francisco has attracted talent all over the United States. Many love the city enough to consider buying properties to make San Francisco their home. For those who are thinking of purchasing a home in the city, they may want to know:
1. is this a good time to buy? 
2. which property type can buyers afford, and in which area? 
3. what are some sample properties being sold at the median property price? 
4. what are the prices buyers should offer for their target properties? 

The property price in San Francisco had increased continously from 2012 to 2019 for 88%. Today, the majority of the properties in the city cost over a million dollars. In this project, with the data scraped from a real estate listing website, I look into the factors that associated with the property price in San Francisco this past year. I am hoping to build a linear regression model that could accurately predict the property price.

### Possible impacts of my project
- Help home buyers in San Francisco determine if they could afford to buy a home in the city and to make informed decision on their offers. 
- This can also help property owners who consider selling their properties to determine if it's a good time to sell now and set a competitive listing price for their properties.
